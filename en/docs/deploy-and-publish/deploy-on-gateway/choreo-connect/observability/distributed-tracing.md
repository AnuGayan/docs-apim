# Distributed Tracing

Performance issues, errors, and exceptions are unfortunate events that may occur in a production environment. In order to identify such an unfortunate event, observing the production environment is essential. WSO2 Choreo Connect provides the ability to observe how the Gateway is handling requests via OpenTelemetry based distributed tracing implementation. By connecting WSO2 Choreo Connect to one of the supported distributed tracing systems, users are able to easily debug and identify production issues.

Supported distributed tracing systems,

- Jaeger
- Zipkin
- Azure Application Insights

## Configure Distributed Tracing

!!! note
    If you are trying out tracing capabilities of WSO2 Choreo Connect and do not have an actual deployment of Jaeger or Zipkin, you can start Choreo Connect deployment with Jaeger/Zipkin by adding one of the below containers to the product `docker-compose` file.

    ```yaml tab="Jaeger"
    jaeger:
      image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.27
      environment:
        - COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=9411
      ports:
        - "5775:5775"
        - "16686:16686"
        - "14268:14268"`
    ```

    ```yaml tab="Zipkin"
    zipkin:
      image: openzipkin/zipkin
      container_name: zipkin
      ports:
        - "9411:9411"
    ```

### Jaeger

When using Jaeger for tracing, you need to use zipkin format to publish span from Choreo Connect. Therefore, the tracer type is configured as zipkin.
Follow the steps listed below to configure WSO2 Choreo Connect with Jaeger,

1. Set the following environment variable to `jaeger` container/pod.
    `COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=9411`
1. {!includes/deploy/cc-configuration-file.md!}

1. Add the following configuration.

  
    ```toml
    [tracing]
      enabled = true
      type = "zipkin"
      [tracing.configProperties]
        host = "jaeger"
        port = "9411"
        endpoint = "/api/v2/spans"
        instrumentationName = "CHOREO-CONNECT"
        maximumTracesPerSecond = "2"
        maxPathLength = "256"
    ```  
1. Start the Choreo Connect deployment.
1. [Create and Deploy an API]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/getting-started/quick-start-guide/quick-start-guide-docker-with-apim/)
1. Invoke the newly created API and open Jaeger UI to view the traces. E.g., `<http://localhost:16686>`.

You will be able to browse through the request traces and expand each trace to view complete details of the trace.

### Zipkin

Follow these steps to configure WSO2 Choreo Connect with Zipkin,

1. {!includes/deploy/cc-configuration-file.md!}

1. Add the following configuration.

  
    ```toml
    [tracing]
      enabled = true
      type = "zipkin"
      [tracing.configProperties]
        host = "zipkin"
        port = "9411"
        endpoint = "/api/v2/spans"
        instrumentationName = "CHOREO-CONNECT"
        maximumTracesPerSecond = "2"
        maxPathLength = "256"
    ```  
1. Start the Choreo Connect deployment.
1. [Create and Deploy an API]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/getting-started/quick-start-guide/quick-start-guide-docker-with-apim/)
1. Invoke the newly created API and open Zipkin UI to view the traces. E.g., <http://localhost:9411>.
1. Filter traces by `serviceName=choreo_connect` query.

You will be able to see all traces. A detailed view of the traces will appear as shown below.

### Azure Application Insights

Follow these steps to configure WSO2 Choreo Connect with Azure Application Insights,

1. First, you need to obtain the `ConnectionString` from the Azure portal.
    * Log in to azure portal.
    * Copy the `Connection String` from the overview page of `Application Insights` resource. E.g., `InstrumentationKey=ab71943f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-fb2eb69ae11d;IngestionEndpoint=https://region.applicationinsights.azure.com/`.
1. {!includes/deploy/cc-configuration-file.md!}

1. Add the following configuration.

    ```toml tab="Configuration"
    [tracing]
      enabled = true
      type = "azure"
      [tracing.configProperties]
        connectionString = {APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING}
        instrumentationName = "CHOREO-CONNECT"
        maximumTracesPerSecond = "2"
    ```
    
    ```toml tab="Example"
    [tracing]
      enabled = true
      type = "azure"
      [tracing.configProperties]
        connectionString = "InstrumentationKey=ab71943f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-fb2eb69ae11d;IngestionEndpoint=https://xxxxxx.applicationinsights.azure.com/"
        instrumentationName = "CHOREO-CONNECT"
        maximumTracesPerSecond = "2"
    ```

1. Start Choreo Connect deployment.
1. [Create and Deploy an API]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/getting-started/quick-start-guide/quick-start-guide-docker-with-apim/)
1. Invoke the newly created API. 
1. Now open "Azure Application Insights" Transaction search window and select `Dependency` for the `Event types` filter. 
    ![Azure Trace Filter]({{base_path}}/assets/img/deploy/mgw/trace-azure-filter.png)

You will be able to see all traces. Detailed trace view will look like below.
